# Kitbook Template

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/jacob-8/kitbook/tree/main/packages/template)

You're looking at the [Kitbook](https://kitbook.vercel.app/) template. This is a minimal template to get you started. See the [examples list](https://kitbook.vercel.app/docs/9-examples) for some repos using Kitbook in production. They will give you better insight.

Note that this is the `index.md` file and is navigated to by clicking the title in the menu header.

To get things started, while don't you jump to a [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) generated auto-updating wiki-link to learn about [[0-file-ordering]]. This works in GitHub, VSCode, and the browser to easily jump between markdown files.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[0-file-ordering]: docs/0-file-ordering.md "File Ordering"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
