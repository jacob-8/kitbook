# File Ordering

Note how this file comes first in your sidebar because `0-file-ordering.md` comes before `1-b.md`.

The same file naming schema applies to folders as well.

Now go look at the [[Image]] component.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[Image]: ../lib/Image.md "Image"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
