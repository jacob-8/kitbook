# i18n

Kitbook can automatically display variants in each of your languages.

To get started, add an array of languages to your config, and a function so Kitbook knows how to add the language to the URL. If your i18n language can be chosen via URL, then you can use the following code:

```ts title="vite.config.ts" {5-9}
import { defineConfig } from 'kitbook/defineConfig'

export default defineConfig({
  // other config...
  languages: [
    { name: 'English', code: 'en', },
    { name: 'Spanish', code: 'es', },
  ],
  addLanguageToUrl: ({ code, url }) => url.replace('[lang]', code),
})
```

The above function would work if you happen to use a dynamic parameter in your route to define the language code (e.g. `/[lang]/foo`).

If you only select language based off browser settings and a cookie-stored value that you save when users change language, then you may need to update your i18n code to also listen to a query param like `lang=de` to set the language. Then you can use the following code to get the language from the URL:

```ts
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)
locale = urlParams.get('lang')
```

And your `addLanguageToUrl` function would be:

```ts
function addLanguageToUrl({ code, url }) {
  const [path, search] = url.split('?')
  const params = new URLSearchParams(search)
  params.set('lang', code)
  return `${path}?${params.toString()}`
}
```

By default Kitbook only displays variants in your first language but the interface has controls to change the displayed language or show multiple languages at once.

## Visual Regression Testing

If you use [[7-visual-regression-testing]], screenshots will be automatically be created using all of your languages.

## Fine-grained language control

Just like viewports have [[3-component-variants#Fine-grained viewport control]], you can override project language defaults on a variant file basis or for an individual variant. For example, in a project with English, Spanish, and French, we could do the following to restrict down to just two or even one language:

```ts title="foo.variants.ts"
import type { Language, Variant } from 'kitbook'
import type Component from './EditInGithub.svelte'

export const languages: Language[] = [
  { code: 'en', name: 'English' },
  { code: 'es', name: 'Spanish' },
]

export const variants: Variant<Component>[] = [
  {
    name: 'English and Spanish',
  },
  {
    name: 'Just Spanish',
    languages: [{ code: 'es', name: 'Spanish' }],
  },
]
```

<!-- Some components may not have any translated strings and so it doesn't make sense to iterate across languages. In that case you can just export an empty languages array from the variants file to show the first language: -->

<!-- title="foo.variants.ts"
export const languages = [] -->

There is also an optional `languages` export from the composition file:

```svelte title="foo.composition"
<script lang="ts" context="module">
  import type { Language } from 'kitbook'

  export const languages: Language[] = [
    { code: 'en', name: 'English' },
    { code: 'fr', name: 'French' },
  ]
</script>
``` 

<!-- Once again, an empty array is a quick way to just show the first language. -->

You've now learned the features of Kitbook as far as they have been documented. As you document and prototype your components for each situation you need, you may run into questions as to how to accomplish something.
