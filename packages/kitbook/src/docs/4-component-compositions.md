# Component Compositions

When you're prototyping and documentation needs go beyond simply passing props and context you can use Compositions. From any Kitbook page documenting a Svelte component, you can click the "Add Composition" button to create a new composition file. This will create a new file with the same name as the component you're documenting, but with the `composition` extension instead of `svelte`. For example, if you're documenting `MyComponent.svelte`, the first composition file will be `MyComponent.composition`. If you want to create further compositions, click the button again and provide a name. If you choose `foo`, the file will be `MyComponent.foo.composition`. Here's a really plain example:

[[4-component-compositions.composition]]

This Kitbook's [[SearchResult]] page also has a simple Composition.

To get these files with the `.composition` extension to work like Svelte files, you'll need to update the extensions property in your svelte config:

```js twoslash title="svelte.config.js" {2}
const config = {
  extensions: ['.svelte', '.composition'],
  // ...
}

export default config
```

And add this VSCode setting:

```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
  "files.associations": {
    "*.composition": "svelte"
  }
}
```

And if you are using eslint:

```js twoslash title=".eslintrc.cjs" {6}
module.exports = {
  overrides: [
    {
      files: [
        '*.svelte',
        '*.composition'
      ]
      // ...
    }
  ]
}
```

You can also create a Composition beside a corresponding markdown documentation page as you see in [[complex-examples]] (look at the source code) - just click the `Add Composition` button when viewing your markdown page.

Now that you have a composition in place, learn how to [[5-write-documentation|document your components]], including sprinkling in compositions where helpful.
