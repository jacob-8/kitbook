# Visual Regression Testing

The simple [[3-component-variants|Variants]] format enables easy visual regression testing of all your components using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and a GitHub action to post the results on your PR as seen [here](https://github.com/jacob-8/kitbook/pull/30#issuecomment-1783993937).

## Install Playwright

```bash
pnpm install -D @playwright/test
```

## Create Snapshots Test File

This function will take your current version of [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and your ([[0-config|Kitbook config]]) to construct urls to each variant found in your `variants.ts` files. It snapshots each url for all your viewports (and [[8-i18n|languages]] if applicable). 

```ts title="e2e/kitbook.spec.ts"
import { getVariants, runComponentTests } from 'kitbook/test'
import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test'
import kitbookConfig from '../kitbook.config'

const variantModules = await getVariants()
runComponentTests({ test, expect, kitbookConfig, variantModules })
```

## Add Playwright config

If you don't already use Playwright the following [config](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration) will get you started. Locally it uses your current dev server if already running, and if not it will start a dev server. On CI it will use the deployment preview url as the base url for the tests run in a GitHub action if you setup an action as described below in [[7-visual-regression-testing#GitHub Action]].

```ts title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test'

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: 'e2e',
  snapshotDir: 'e2e/snapshots',
  snapshotPathTemplate: '{snapshotDir}/{arg}-{projectName}-{platform}{ext}',
  fullyParallel: true,
  reporter: 'html',
  retries: 0, // important to keep at 0 as we are expecting "failures" for changed snapshots and don't want to produce multiple change snapshots for each retry
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  use: {
    baseURL: process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:5173',
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },
  ],
  webServer: {
    command: 'pnpm run dev',
    port: 5173,
    reuseExistingServer: true,
  },
})
```

## Add to .gitignore

```txt title=".gitignore"
**/e2e/snapshots/*
playwright-report
test-results
```

## Add Test Commands

These script will run playwright against all test files with "kitbook" in the name which will just pick up our component tests. The first will update snapshots to create a base and the second will be used to compare against the base for changes.

```txt title="package.json"
"test:components:update": "playwright test kitbook --update-snapshots",
"test:components": "playwright test kitbook",
```

Now you can run these commands and see the test results.

The action below is assuming that you are just running your component snapshot tests, but with some simple adjustments you could also incorporate your other Playwright tests into the same test runs if
you're already using Playwright for e2e tests. However, do note that an easy way to keep them separate because of different settings or other conflicts is to create a custom playwright config file like `playwright.components.config.ts` and add the config flag to your script commands above, e.g. `--config playwright.components.config.ts`.

You may also enjoy using the Playwright UI runner locally by adding the `--ui` flag.

## Add Changed Snapshots as PR Comment

Next, setup a Google Cloud Storage bucket to store snapshots and add a GitHub action that will comment on your PR with changed snapshots on every push.

### Google Cloud Storage Bucket

[Create a new bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/create-bucket) using the standard storage class and uncheck `Enforce public access prevention on this bucket`. Then in your bucket go to the `Permissions` tab and add a new principal `allUsers` with the `Storage Object Viewer` role and save. This is described [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/making-data-public#buckets). 


Still in the Google Cloud Console, create a [service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey) for your project with the `Storage Folder Admin` role. Then from that service account, create a service account key, download it as JSON, remove line breaks, and store it as a secret in your GitHub repo using `GCS_COMPONENT_CHECK_BUCKETS_CREDENTIALS` or something you consider more helpful.

### GitHub Action

The following action will use your recently created storage bucket along with Vercel deployment urls to comment on your PR with changed snapshots. Note each of the places pointed to with hands ðŸ‘‡ where you need to update using your own details.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/component-tests.yml"

Snapshots will look slightly different on each platform, mainly because of font rendering differences, so know that comparisons don't work well across different types of devices (e.g. your PC vs colleagues' Mac). So just use the ones created in a Linux CI environment for comparisons.

**Great!** You've set up a completely free visual regression testing system for your components!

## Tips

### Skip Files

If you need to pass a Svelte component into a variant as a prop, you'll need to skip taking screenshots for that variants file as Playwright will choke when trying to import the Svelte file. You can pass an array of `skipFiles` (without extensions) like this:

```ts title="e2e/kitbook.spec.ts" {5-7,10}
import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test'
import { getVariants, runComponentTests } from 'kitbook/test'
import kitbookConfig from '../kitbook.config'

const skipFiles = [
  '/routes/foo/+page',
  '/lib/ui/Button',
]

const variantModules = await getVariants({ skipFiles })
runComponentTests({ test, expect, kitbookConfig, variantModules })
```

If you know a way to update Playwright's file parsing to handle imported Svelte files, please submit a PR. Or at least a way to ignore the Svelte file. That's not the data we need to run the tests. We only need file locations, variant names, viewports and languages.

### Turn off Vercel Comments

You may notice from time to time that the comment call-to-action button shows up in your snapshots. If you don't use Vercel comments, you can [turn off comments](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments/how-comments-work#at-the-account-level).

### Use $lib imports in variants

Sometimes its nice to use `$lib` imports when assembling your mock data for variants. You will need to specify your path aliases directly in your `tsconfig.json` and not the extended svelte config. Also add `baseUrl` [according to the Playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-typescript#tsconfig-path-mapping):


```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "extends": "./.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ... other settings
    "paths": {
      "$lib": [
        "./src/lib"
      ],
      "$lib/*": [
        "./src/lib/*"
      ]
    },
    "baseUrl": "."
  }
}
```

### Compositions (coming soon)

Screenshotting compositions is not yet supported but it will be added. In the meantime, if you read the source code used for variants you could probably set it up yourself.
