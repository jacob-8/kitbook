# Visual Regression Testing: In progress

Beyond simply giving an easy way to mock components in a variety of states, the simple [[3-component-variants|Variants]] format of Kitbook enables easy visual regression testing of all your components using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). Here's how to set things up.

## Install Playwright

```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
```

## Add a custom Playwright config


## Add GitHub Actions


## Image cleanup
