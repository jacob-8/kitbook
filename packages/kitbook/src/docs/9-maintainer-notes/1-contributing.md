Would love to have you help! Read the [[0-roadmap|Roadmap]] for good places to start. We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Or work on Kitbook locally:

- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm stub`
- `pnpm dev`

To update the Kitbook code while using it in your own app, you can change your `devDependency` to point to it instead of npm by using something like `"kitbook": "link:../kitbook/packages/kitbook",` then run `pnpm package:watch` in Kitbook to keep it updating on changes.
