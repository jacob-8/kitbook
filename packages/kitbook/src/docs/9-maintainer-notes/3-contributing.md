Contributions are welcome! After cloning the monorepo, with pnpm installed on your machine, run `pnpm i` and `pnpm dev` to get started.

## Customization

The default Kitbook components are relatively simple. If you'd like to create your own theme please do so. If you think others will benefit from your improvements, please fork the repo and submit a pull request.
