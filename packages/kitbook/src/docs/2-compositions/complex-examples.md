## Complex User Interaction

**NOTE: This page is in construction as compositions are under construction - you can ignore it for now.**

Sometimes building components is more about testing interaction than they are about mocking various component states. In the `BottomSheet` component found in the [svelte-pieces](https://github.com/jacob-8/kitbook/tree/main/packages/svelte-pieces) package also in this monorepo. A Story component was set up that allowed for quick adjustment of some opening height props such that the component can be tested in a variety of conditions.

Note especially the use of the helper `ShowHide` component. As a Story is just Svelte, you can do anything, even use `setContext` in your stories file.

## Conglomeration of many components

Sometimes you may want to prototype an arrangement of multiple components together. The following example combines a `Map`, `GeoJSONSource`, and `Layer` component from the [Living Dictionaries repo](https://github.com/livingtongues/living-dictionaries) into a display of earthquake clusters.
