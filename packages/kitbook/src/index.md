# KitBook 

Documentation, Prototyping, Inspection & Testing Workbench Tool for Svelte built with SvelteKit that lets you rapidly build, document, and test components. Inspired by [Svench](https://svench-docs.vercel.app/) and [[why|others]].

## Best Features
- File-based sidebar tree structure, with optional prefixed numbers to adjust ordering of your docs
- Iframe isolation for easy media query testing
- [[3-component-variants|Variants]] and [[4-component-compositions|Compositions]] are [[Rendering-Platform|SSR rendered and then hydrated client-side]] just like the rest of your SvelteKit app
- Quickly create and compare [[3-component-variants|Variants]] of a component via **typesafe** exported prop objects in a colocated `.variants.ts` file that can also be used for testing, especially visual regression tests of your components.
- Use [[5-write-documentation|markdown]] to enable easy documenation as you build
- All SvelteKit-only imports are automatically available because it runs inside your regular SvelteKit app. No need for any special mocks or compatibility hacks. 
- Build components using the same context as your main app, like i18n.
- [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) based automatic updating [[6-easy-wikilinks|wiki-links]] for easy linking between pages within your Kitbook that will never get out of date.
- Conveniently view component state from your app and quickly create component variants the [[2-viewer]] tool.
- Great [[8-i18n]] support
- Unlimited [[7-visual-regression-testing]] with Playwright
