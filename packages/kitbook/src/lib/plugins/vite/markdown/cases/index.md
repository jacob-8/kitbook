# KitBook 

Documentation, Prototyping, Inspection & Testing Workbench Tool for Svelte built with SvelteKit that lets you rapidly build, document, and test components. Inspired by [Svench](https://svench-docs.vercel.app/) and [[9-why|others]].

## Features
- File-based sidebar tree structure, with optional prefixed numbers to adjust ordering of your docs
- Iframe isolation for easy media query testing
- Variants and Compositions load via SSR first and then are hydrated client-side just like a SvelteKit app
- Uses markdown to enable easy documenation as you build
- Quickly create and compare numerous variants of a component via an array of typesafe prop objects in a colocated typescript file that can also be used for testing, especially visual regression tests of your components.
- All SvelteKit-only imports are automatically avaiable because it run inside your regular SvelteKit app. No need for any special mocks or compatibility hacks. 
- Build components using the same context as your main app, like i18n
- [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) based automatic updating wiki-links for easy linking between pages within your Kitbook that will never get out of date.
<!-- - Easy knobs allow for adjusting a component's view state (special thanks @rixo's Svench and Rich Harris' svelte-knobby!) -->
