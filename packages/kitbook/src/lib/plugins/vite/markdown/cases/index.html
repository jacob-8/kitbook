<p>Documentation, Prototyping, Inspection &#x26; Testing Workbench Tool for Svelte built with SvelteKit that lets you rapidly build, document, and test components. Inspired by <a href="https://svench-docs.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Svench</a> and [<a href="../../../../../docs/9-why" title="Why not use an already existing alternative? (9-why)">others</a>].</p>

<ul>
  <li>File-based sidebar tree structure, with optional prefixed numbers to adjust ordering of your docs</li>
  <li>Iframe isolation for easy media query testing</li>
  <li>Variants and Compositions load via SSR first and then are hydrated client-side just like a SvelteKit app</li>
  <li>Uses markdown to enable easy documenation as you build</li>
  <li>Quickly create and compare numerous variants of a component via an array of typesafe prop objects in a colocated typescript file that can also be used for testing, especially visual regression tests of your components.</li>
  <li>All SvelteKit-only imports are automatically avaiable because it run inside your regular SvelteKit app. No need for any special mocks or compatibility hacks.</li>
  <li>Build components using the same context as your main app, like i18n</li>
  <li><a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Foam</a> based automatic updating wiki-links for easy linking between pages within your Kitbook that will never get out of date.</li>
